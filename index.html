<p>On <a href=https://www.codecademy.com>Codecademy</a> I started "Learn the Comman Line" course. The first lesson covers a number of topics, such as navigation in a file tree, manipulation of the file system, redirecting input and output, and configuring the environment.</p>
<h1>Navigation</h1>
<p>ls - command that prints the contents of a directory you are currently in. 
By adding -a, -l, -t to ls command it is possible to print hidden files, pront them in long format, or sort by time they were last modified.
pwd - command that prints current working directory.
cd - changes working directory to another specified one.
mkdir - creates a directory in a current directory.
touch - creates a new file inside the current directory
</p>

<h1>Manipulation</h1>
<p> cp - copies files. For example: cp oceans.txt geography.txt.
mv - moves and renames files.
rm - removes files and rm -r removes directories.</p>

<h1>Redirection</h1>
<p>echo - prints a line in terminal
> - redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
>> - redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
< - redirects standard input to a command.
| - redirects standard output of a command line to another command.

sort - sorts line alphabetically in a file
uniq - filters duplicates, adjecent lines of text.
grep - searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
sed - searches for a text pattern, modifies it and outputs it.
</p>

<h1>Environment</h1>
<p>The nano editor is a command line text editor used to change the environment. ~/.bash_profile is where the settings are stored. To open it in nano, type nano ~/.bash_profile.
Environment variables: 
export VARIABLE="Value" - sets and exports an environment varible.
USER - username of a current user.
PS1 - the command promt.
HOME - home directory.
PATH - returns a  colon separated list of all paths.
env - returns a list of environmet varibles.</p>
